Here’s how to make a request for repairs without ticking off the seller.

Recently, one of my agents came to me with some issues regarding the request for repairs on a property that had a home inspection done. Of course, the inspector was just doing their job—combing through the home and calling out issues with regard to maintenance and possible code violations. The buyer then wanted the agent to put together a list of repairs, but that is a tad more nuanced than you might think; if the buyer gives the seller a laundry list of repairs to handle, the seller could cancel. Though sellers rarely do, they always have the power to back out, so we agents must find a tactful way to make clear the buyer’s requests that preserves the deal. 

When given a list of repairs, a seller always has five options: 


  Do some of them
  Do all of them 
  Do none of them
  Drop a credit in lieu of repairs
  Make partial repairs and drop partial credit. 


“Addressing repairs up front in your purchase agreement can save you a ton of grief!”

As a buyer, it’s best to address the issue of repairs  in advance when you write your offer. In the purchase agreement, the buyer can proactively: 


  Limit the dollar amount in the request for repairs (e.g., “any and all repairs not to exceed $500”) 
  State that all inspections will be used for informational purposes only—nothing will be asked of the seller 
  Remove the inspection contingencies altogether (Warning: To justify this kind of risk, the house would have to appear to be in excellent shape)  


While each strategy has advantages and disadvantages, all are ways to get your offer accepted without killing the transaction in the inspection phase. Negotiations can be a little tricky, but what the buyer usually wants is for the seller to fix as much as possible without getting ticked off. As a buyer, you’re already in a tight market, and half the battle was getting your offer accepted; the last thing you want to do is irritate the seller to the point that they withdraw from the deal, leaving you back where you started—a low-inventory, high-competition jungle floor. 

If you find that the home needs significantly more work than you thought it did, it may just be best to walk away from it. Thankfully, though, you’ll almost always be able to work out issues with the seller if you have the right approach. Remember: Addressing repairs up front in your purchase agreement can save you a ton of grief! 

Every case is unique; this information covers most of what comes up in routine home inspections, but not all. If you have questions on this or any other real estate topic, please reach out by phone or email. I’m always more than happy to have an in-depth chat with curious homeowners, sellers, and buyers.

These four tips will help your buyer come out on top in a bidding war.

Recently, one of my agents came to me and said, “Ron, how do I get my offer accepted? My buyers keep getting beaten out.” If you’re asking yourself the same thing, there are four main things you can do to elevate your buyer’s offer to the top of sellers’ minds. 

First, make sure your buyer is pre-approved by a local lender. When there’s a local lender involved, chances are good that local agents know them and have built trust with them. 

Second, put down a large deposit. Although most of the houses in our area are listed between $300,000 and $500,000, I’ve seen some people put down deposits as low as $2,500. That kind of a deposit won’t make your buyer look strong in a seller’s eyes. If they can put down a $10,000, $20,000, or even $30,000 deposit and write that into the purchase agreement, however, it’ll go a long way toward their offer getting accepted. 

Third, remove some contingencies. You need a very strong buyer to attempt this. One contingency they can remove, for instance, is the appraisal contingency. In a competitive market, the price of a home tends to get bid upward, so if your buyer is strong financially and has cash reserves, they can remove the appraisal contingency. 

“You have to look at the seller’s bottom line because that’s what they’re looking at when they have multiple offers.”

However, they should understand that this means they’ll have to make up the cash difference if the appraisal doesn’t match the agreed-upon sale price. If they can make up the whole difference, that’s great. If they can’t, they can still cover a portion of the difference. For example, they can agree to pay an extra $10,000 above the appraised value (not to exceed the agreed-upon sale price) if the appraisal comes in low. 

Other ideas for this tip include:


  Closing the gap in the contingency removal period. The default period is 17 days, so try shortening it to 10 days.
  Telling the seller that you’ll still order a home inspection, but you won’t ask for any repairs. 
  Telling the seller you’ll order a wood-destroying organisms report, but you won’t ask them to fix anything.


You have to look at the seller’s bottom line because that’s what they’re looking at when they have multiple offers: who’s the strongest, won’t cost them any money, can close on their terms, etc. 

Lastly, find out what’s most important to the seller. It may not be the highest-priced offer. They may need to do a rent-back or establish a 60-day escrow period. The only way to find out is to call their agent and find out what they want most. 

If you try these tips and still have a hard time getting your offer accepted, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
