<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s my take on why lead follow-up is more important than lead generation.</em></p>

Lead generation versus lead follow-up: Which one is more important? Well, much like the “nature versus nurture” debate in science, the word “versus” can be misleading here; the two concepts are highly interconnected, and a good agent needs them both to succeed. That said, I do actually believe one is inherently more important, and today I’ll explain why. I’ll also offer a simple strategy for consistently following up with everyone in your sphere of influence. Remember: Your sphere doesn’t just include the people you know personally—it also includes everyone else who’s just a mutual connection or two away from you.
