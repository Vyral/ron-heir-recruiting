<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s why you may not want to ever hand out your business cards again.</em></p>

<em>“Whoops, I left my business card in the car!”</em>

We’ve all had this happen to us, haven't we? As agents, we meet people all the time and hand out business cards constantly. The thing is, if the person you meet doesn’t have a business card—like a homebuyer or home seller—**they may give you a bogus phone number,** if they give you one at all. 

What can you do to prevent this? If you’re talking with a buyer or seller and they ask for your business card, say, “Oh, I’m sorry, I left them at the office.” (Or somewhere where it’s not convenient to go get them). Then say, “How about I text it to you?”, pull out your phone, ask for their number and text them your business card or contact information.

**If you hand out a business card because someone asks for it and hope they call you, you have no way to follow up with them.** Once you ask them for their cellphone number and put it in your phone, text or call them right away. If they give you the wrong number, you must ask yourself: Do you really want to follow up with someone who’s not truthful and motivated? Motivated and interested people are more likely to give you their correct information.  

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to hear from you.
