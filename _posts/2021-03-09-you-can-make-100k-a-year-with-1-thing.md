Just one thing will help you make over $100,000 per year consistently, and luckily, you already have it: your sphere of influence.&nbsp;

In author Tim Templeton’s book “The Referral of a Lifetime,” he says that **everyone knows at least 150 to 250 people**, this includes your friends, family, neighbors, coworkers, and people with whom you already do business. Let them know that you’re in the business of helping people buy and sell real estate, and ask them who they know that’s considering buying or selling. Stay in contact; call, text, email, send a postcard, connect with them on social media, take them out for coffee or lunch. Just stay in contact and let them know you’re a valuable resource.&nbsp;

There are many different formulas out there, but typically you should be getting 10 transactions for every 100 people in your database. If you’re not, **you may want to take a look at your lead follow-up habits**. If you work your database consistently, have 200 people in it, and close 20 transactions, you’ll make well over $100,000 per year.&nbsp;
