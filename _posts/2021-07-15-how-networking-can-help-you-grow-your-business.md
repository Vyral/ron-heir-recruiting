As an agent, one of the simplest ways you can add sales to your business is to network. Networking helps you expand your sphere of influence and grow your database, allowing you to connect with new clients and get referrals.&nbsp;

In my experience, an easy way to grow your network is to join organizations and clubs, such as the Chamber of Commerce, Rotary Club, PTA, and countless others. **Become an active, viable member and participate in meetings—you could even work your way up to becoming an officer.** When members see how serious you are about what you do, they’ll be more likely to give you their business.

A friend once told me that in any particular group, only 10% of the members do any work. Though I don’t have statistics or data to back it up, it seems like my friend was right. Be part of the 10% and create relationships with the leaders, and you’ll be more likely to find new clients.&nbsp;

For example, I helped the local Chamber of Commerce for a while—after about a year and a half, they asked me to be on their board of directors. Since I accepted, I’ve met many people and have been able to help a number of them with their buying and selling needs. Further, I received referrals from the people I helped.

There are usually a lot of Realtors involved in local organizations, but I was able to stand out by getting involved, getting to know people, and creating relationships. **In order to get, you have to give—but you have to give first.**

If you’d like more information about growing your business, or if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
