Today we want to show you how to get more business with an open house. There are two reasons to hold an open house: to get the home sold and, **more importantly, to get more business for the real estate agent.&nbsp;**

Make sure that the home has good curb appeal. The landscaping should be all in order, and the interior should be neat and clean. The state of the home is a reflection of you as an agent. This also extends to how you look, so make sure you are dressed professionally and properly.

Before the open house, you need to do your homework on the neighborhood. Check to see if there’s competition, and look for homes in escrow and that have sold. This information can be invaluable when people ask you questions, so keep it handy when you have visitors to the house.

**You will also want to canvas the neighborhood for the open house.** Knock on about 100 doors and hand out flyers. This will help make sure the open house is successful, and it’s also a good time to pick up new clients by asking people if they are planning to move soon or if they know anyone who is.

On the day of the open house, have plenty of signs pointing to the address of the home. Put as much information on this sign as you can. However, be sure to check with the local municipalities first to see if it is okay to put signs on public property.

Also, gather visitor information. **Get people’s addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses so that you can follow up with them.** Ask them specific questions if you can: Do they live in the neighborhood, how long have they lived there, have they thought about moving?

Open houses can be a great way to grow your business if you take the time to make sure you are prepared for them. If you have any questions regarding this or another real estate matter, give me a call.&nbsp;
