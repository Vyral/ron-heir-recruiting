<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s how to make a request for repairs without ticking off the seller.</em></p>

Recently, one of my agents came to me with some issues regarding the request for repairs on a property that had a home inspection done. Of course, the inspector was just doing their job—combing through the home and calling out issues concerning maintenance and possible code violations. The buyer then wanted the agent to put together a list of repairs, but that is a tad more nuanced than you might think; if the buyer gives the seller a laundry list of repairs to handle, the seller could cancel. Though sellers rarely do, they always have the power to back out, so we agents must find a tactful way to make clear the buyer’s requests and still preserve the deal. &nbsp;

**When given a list of repairs, a seller always has five options:&nbsp;**

* Do some of them
* Do all of them&nbsp;
* Do none of them
* Drop a credit in lieu of repairs
* Make partial repairs and drop partial credit&nbsp;

For buyers, it’s best to address the issue of repairs &nbsp;in advance when you write your offer. **In the purchase agreement, the buyer can proactively:&nbsp;**

* Limit the dollar amount in the request for repairs (e.g., “any and all repairs not to exceed $500”)&nbsp;
* State that all inspections will be used for informational purposes only—nothing will be asked of the seller&nbsp;
* Remove the inspection contingencies altogether (Warning: To justify this kind of risk, the house would have to appear to be in excellent shape) &nbsp;

While each strategy has advantages and disadvantages, all are ways to get your offer accepted without killing the transaction in the inspection phase. Negotiations can be a little tricky, but what the buyer usually wants is for the seller to fix as much as possible without getting upset. Buyers are already in a tight market, and half the battle was getting their offer accepted. The last thing you want to do is irritate the seller to the point that they withdraw from the deal, leaving you back where you started—in a low-inventory, high-competition market.&nbsp;

If you find that the home needs significantly more work than you thought it did, it may just be best to walk away from it. Thankfully, though, you’ll almost always be able to work out issues with the seller if you have the right approach. Remember: Addressing repairs up front in your purchase agreement can save you a ton of grief\!&nbsp;

Every case is unique; this information covers most of what comes up in routine home inspections, but not all. If you have questions on this or any other real estate topic, please reach out by phone or email. I’m always more than happy to have an in-depth chat with curious real estate agents about any matter.&nbsp;
